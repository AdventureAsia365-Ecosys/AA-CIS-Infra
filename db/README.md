# db/ — migrations applied to the shared RDS (acc2)

RDS is VPC-private, so migrations are applied by the **DB Migrate** workflow
(`.github/workflows/db-migrate.yml`): it starts a one-off ECS Fargate task from the CIS api task
definition, which downloads `run_migration.py` and the SQL via presigned S3 URLs and runs it
with the task's own `DATABASE_URL`.

```
db/migrations/<owner>/<NNN>_<name>.sql   # owner = cis | tripplanner | booking
```

Version key registered in `shared.schema_versions`: `cis` → `NNN`, `tripplanner` → `tp-NNN`,
`booking` → `bk-NNN` (ownership rules: `AA-Ecosys/docs/database/schema-ownership.md`).

## Flow
0. The owner repo merges a **migration-file-only** PR to its `main` first (S237 D8). Code that
   reads the new objects comes in a later PR, after the apply.
1. PR adds the SQL here as a byte-identical copy (`cp` the owner file; human review = the
   approval). **Migration Copy Guard** (`.github/workflows/migration-copy-guard.yml`, AA-807)
   compares each added/changed file with the owner's `main` through the GitHub API and fails on:
   a path DB Migrate would refuse, a missing or wrongly prefixed `shared.schema_versions` key, a
   file not on the owner's `main` yet ("merge the migration-only PR in the owner repo first"), or
   any byte difference. It also runs nightly over every copy. Local run:
   `GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) python3 db/check_migration_copies.py db/migrations/cis/228_x.sql`
   (or `--all`; without a token GitHub allows 60 anonymous requests/hour); tests:
   `python3 -m unittest discover -s db/tests`.
2. Merge to `main`.
3. Run **DB Migrate** on `main` with `mode=check` (prints whether the version is registered),
   then `mode=apply`. The job fails unless the task exits 0 and the version is in
   `shared.schema_versions` afterwards. Re-running `apply` is a no-op.
4. Regenerate `AA-Ecosys/docs/architecture/db-schema-reference.md` after structural changes.

## Rules
- Every file self-registers: `INSERT INTO shared.schema_versions ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`,
  inside its own `BEGIN; ... COMMIT;`.
- The owner repo keeps the identical original (`AA-CIS-App/api/migrations/`,
  `AA-TripPlanner-Web/migrations/`, `AA-Booking/migrations/`); this folder holds the copy the
  workflow applies, checked byte for byte against the owner's `main`. Infra itself
  owns no schema. Apply the migration **before** merging app
  code that depends on it.
- Destructive changes follow the DRY RUN procedure (`skill/aa-cis-schema/references/destructive-ops.md`).
